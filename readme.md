# Learning SQL Reference Guide

This repository is meant to be a reference of materials to learn all about [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).  This can be used by folks who are new to to the data space and/or SQL altogether and seasoned professionals to brush up on things, or provide additional materials for junior folks to use to learn. 

Note: This is largely biased towards SQL Server, as this is where most of my knowledge converges to, however most of these concepts are portable to other RDBMS's such as Oracle, MySQL.  The SQL code itself, if written in its [ANSI](https://blog.ansi.org/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2023-ansi-x3-135/#gref) form is also portable to databases of all flavors such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Databricks SQL (Although, the latter is not really a database, but I hope you get my point!).
